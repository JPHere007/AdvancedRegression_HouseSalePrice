## General Information
- This project is an applicaton of Advanced Regression model where we trying to identify various learnings of Lasso, Ridge & Linear regression technique to predict House Sale price for a private company 
    
- Background of your project: A US-based housing company named Surprise Housing has decided to enter the Australian market. The company   required to build a regression model using regularisation in order to predict the actual value of the prospective properties and decide whether to invest in them or not.
    
- Business probem that your project is trying to solve: US Based Housing company wants to know:
  * Which variables are significant in predicting the price of a house
  * How well those variables describe the price of a house.
- Dataset that is being used: train.csv dataset


<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
- By applying Lasso & Ridge regression models we found optimal value of 0.0001 with Lasso regression can be used
  to build the model.
- Model has R2 score of 0.849573 (Training Data) & 0.816495 ( Test Dataset), which is pretty good.
- Data has around 30 prdicator variables in the final model.

## Technologies Used
- numpy, pandas, matplotlib for Dataframe & Plot creation
- sklearn & statsmodel, Ridge, Lasso, LinearRegression for linear Regression modelling
- model_selection, model_selection, metrics from sklearn

<!-- As the libraries versions keep on changing, it is recommended to mention the version of library used in this project -->
